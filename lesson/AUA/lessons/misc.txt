Existentialists say life is a problem. the purpose of scholarship is to solve that problem.
Nietsche is sometimes classed as an  existentialist.
Freud says, if you have a problem it's because something went wrong in your development.

If you say what something is, you are guaranteed to be wrong. 
if you say what something is not your automatically correct.
we tend not to like negative people because it's too easy, it's a cheap shot. We like people who dare to take a stand and try to prove something.

I'm trying to understand this deep connection that people have to the forest. She talks about a network of energy that flows through all living things. She says all energy is only borrowed, and one day you have to give it back.

A guy dies and finds himself welcomed to the afterlife by a brilliant, all encompassing light; by an almighty being who tells him that he can now pursue his wildest dreams for all eternity. There are no rules. He can do whatever he wants. And he can travel anywhere in the universe in an instant. For the first ten thousand years or so the guy is having the time of his life. But after a million years, he’s got the been there, done that syndrome. He’s bored out of his mind and weary of the burden of consciousness. So he finds the almighty being and asks that his existence be ended. But he’s told that this is the one thing that isn’t possible. So he goes off for another billion years. Finally, he’s so fatigued, so bored, that he begs for his existence to be ended. And once again he’s told this isn’t possible. ‘Well if that’s the case,’ he says angrily, ‘then I’d rather be in hell.’ To which the almighty being, from deep within the all-encompassing light, replies, ‘Where do you think you are?

Confirmation bias. This is our tendency to seek out information that supports and reinforces our beliefs, and ignore or discount any information that is contrar
Only two years later, a descendant of this program, AlphaZero, taught itself to play three games of nearly infinite complexity—all with superhuman skill—in less than a day. Programmers simply input the rules of the games and set it the goal of winning, without any further strategy, tactics, or instruction on how to play. And then it did play—against itself. Many millions and billions of games. After only eight hours of self-play, this new program was able to beat its talented predecessor, AlphaGo. Then, after four hours of teaching itself the game of chess—four hours!—it destroyed the world’s best computer chess program, Stockfish, which had long been capable of destroying the best humans. AlphaZero annihilated Stockfish, using a style of play that experts described as totally alien—not human, not computer, but a style that had never been seen before in the history of chess. Then, almost as an afterthought, after two additional hours of self-play, AlphaZero became the world’s best program in the game of shogi, a Japanese version of chess. These performances were as alarming as they were stunning, especially since the programmers had no idea how AlphaZero was choosing its moves. It had grown far beyond its creators’ ability to fathom.
First, people are born to worry. That’s how we made it to the top of the food chain. Constant anxiety is the curse that comes with consciousness, with sentience. We’re the only species smart enough to fear not only actual, present threats, but also a myriad of imagined threats. Worse, we’re the only species burdened with the knowledge of our own mortality. And this makes us the most neurotic animal on Earth.”

The laws of nature cannot be deceived; the reaction will come. If a man is jealous of you, you will find, when you search your heart, that you have been jealous either of him or of someone else sometime in the past. Be kind to him, and the surroundings will be kind to you; be loving to him, and the surroundings will be loving to you; begin to doubt, and the surroundings begin to doubt you. If you hate, the surroundings begin to hate you. If the surroundings begin to hate you, do not blame the surroundings, blame your own inner conscience.
